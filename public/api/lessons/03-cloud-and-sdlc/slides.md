### **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and Cloud: Real-World Examples**
---

### **Introduction (What is SDLC?)**
- Definition: A structured approach guiding software development through well-defined stages.
- Key stages: Requirement Analysis, Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, Maintenance.
---

### **The "Arab Telephone" Game**
- Problem: Miscommunication during **Requirement Gathering** leads to incorrect outputs.  
- Scenario: A simple request for scheduling software evolves into a complex AI platform due to unclear communication.

+ Use tools like **Jira**, **Confluence**, and **Figma** to document and clarify requirements.  
+ Employ visual aids to verify understanding early.
---

### **The Tree Swing Analogy**
- Problem: Misalignment of expectations between stakeholders and developers.  
- Impact: Each phase produces results vastly different from what the client intended.

+ Collaborative tools like **Slack**, **Monday.com**, and cloud-based workshops via **Zoom**.  
+ Use prototypes (e.g., Adobe XD) to gather feedback before coding.

### **Pizza Order Analogy**
- Problem: Orders donâ€™t meet customer expectations due to poor communication or execution.  
- Solution:  
  1. Requirement Gathering: Dynamic order forms via **Google Forms** or **AWS AppSync**.  
  2. Testing: Simulate high traffic with **AWS Load Balancer**.  
  3. Maintenance: Monitor using **AWS CloudWatch**.

+ Pizza-making flowchart aligned with SDLC stages.  
+ Icons: AWS AppSync, Google Forms, CloudWatch.

### **Real-World Case Study**
1. **Requirement Analysis**:  
   - Tools: **Google Workspace, Slack, Zoom**.
   - Purpose: Collect and align requirements.  

2. **Design**:  
   - Tools: **Figma, Lucidchart**.
   - Purpose: Share and validate prototypes.

3. **Testing**:  
   - Tools: **BrowserStack, AWS Device Farm**.  
   - Purpose: Simulate real-world conditions.

4. **Deployment and Maintenance**:  
   - Tools: **AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Datadog**.  
   - Purpose: Ensure scalability and performance.

**Visuals**:  
- Table summarizing tools for each phase.  
- Cloud logos.

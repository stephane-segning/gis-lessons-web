## üé® **7. UI/UX Designers: Masters of Usability**

### Overview

UI/UX Designers focus on creating user-friendly interfaces and enhancing user satisfaction.

### Key Responsibilities

- Conduct user research and testing to understand pain points.
- Design wireframes, mockups, and prototypes.
- Ensure visual and functional consistency.

### Case Study

In developing a ride-sharing app, UI/UX Designers simplified the booking process into three taps. They also added accessibility features for visually impaired users.

---

## ‚òÅÔ∏è **8. DevOps Engineers: Deployment Experts**

### Overview

DevOps Engineers bridge development and operations, ensuring seamless code deployment and system stability.

### Key Responsibilities

- Configure CI/CD pipelines for automated build and deployment.
- Manage cloud resources and monitor performance.
- Implement tools to support development workflows.

### Case Study

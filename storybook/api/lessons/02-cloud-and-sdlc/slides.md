### Evolution of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and the Role of Cloud Computing

---

## 🌟 The Software Crisis: A Turning Point
By [The God Marco](https://github.com/Marcjazz)

---

### Origins of the Crisis

- 1960s–70s: Rapid hardware growth, insufficient methodologies
- Budget overruns, missed deadlines, incomplete products

---

### Software Crisis Timeline

    title Software Crisis Timeline
    1960 : Rapid Hardware Evolution
    1965 : Lack of Structured Methods
    1970 : Birth of SDLC
    1975 : Adoption of Structured Models
```

---

### Causes of the Crisis

- **Hardware Evolution**: Complexity outpaced developers
- **Inefficient Processes**: Chaotic workflows
- **Inadequate Testing**: Poorly functioning products
- **Communication Gaps**: Misaligned user expectations

---

### Resolution and SDLC

- Adoption of structured methods
- Clear project roadmap
- Efficiency and alignment with user needs

---

## ☁️ The Advent of Cloud Computing

---

### Historical Context

- **1950s**: Time-sharing systems
- **1970s**: Virtual machines
- **1990s**: Network services and modern cloud platforms

---

### Why Cloud Computing?

- **Cost Efficiency**: Minimized hardware expenses
- **Scalability**: Dynamic resource scaling
- **Flexibility**: Global access
- **Performance**: Managed infrastructures

---

### Example

**Company X**: AWS migration → 40% cost reduction, auto-scaling, 99.9% uptime
